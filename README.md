# Run Well
Run Well is a Swift-based iOS app for iPhone that summarizes real- and future-time weather conditions for runners. It queries OpenWeather's API for weather data such as temperature, precipitation, air quality, and UV index. It then analyzes these data points, and returns to the user a score of what current running conditions are like, on a scale from 1-10. The user may choose to see current conditions, or select any time in the next 48 hours. They can also select to see conditions for any location.
